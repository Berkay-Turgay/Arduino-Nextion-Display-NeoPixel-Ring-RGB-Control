# Arduino-Nextion-Display-NeoPixel-Ring-RGB-Control
This project provides an advanced RGB control interface using an Arduino, 2.4 inch Nextion touchscreen display, and a NeoPixel (WS2812) 12-LED ring. Each individual LED on the NeoPixel ring can be controlled through the Nextion interface using dedicated RGB sliders, brightness adjustment, and live color preview.

## Features

Individual LED control: Set independent R–G–B values for each NeoPixel

Global control: Apply a color to the entire ring at once

Live preview: Changes update instantly on the NeoPixel ring

Nextion UI: RGB sliders, LED index selector, and color display

Fully compatible with WS2812 / NeoPixel LEDs

Stable serial communication between Arduino and Nextion
