# Arduino-Nextion-Display-NeoPixel-Ring-RGB-Control
This project provides an advanced RGB control interface using an Arduino, a Nextion touchscreen display, and a NeoPixel (WS2812) LED ring. Each individual LED on the NeoPixel ring can be controlled through the Nextion interface using dedicated RGB sliders, brightness adjustment, and live color preview.
